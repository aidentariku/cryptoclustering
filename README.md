This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook analyzing cryptocurrency market data using K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It loads market data, scales features, and applies K-Means clustering to group cryptocurrencies. The notebook visually determines the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method. Additionally, it employs PCA to reduce dimensionality and visualizes cluster distributions in scatter plots. The provided code and visualizations offer insights into grouping cryptocurrencies based on market performance and understanding market trends efficiently.
